				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiement attempts to represent the inspiring source image below as a simplified 2D procedurally generated background.<br>				
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Using random seeds, I generated various complex polygon shapes which followed exponential curves.<br>
					I then stored each point of each curve such that an exact replica could be recreated in the water's reflection.<br>
					I created a function to facilitate this drawing process. Then, according to the seed,<br>
					I created random number and locations of ice floes, which populate the water's surface, selling the image better.<br>
					These ice floes move according to the timecode, and dissapear if the user hovers over them.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The primary difficulty in creating this process came from the way I chose to slope the mountains, and use their curvature.<br>
					The slopeage caused lots of problems, as it would constantly poke into the water wierdly, or obscure great portions of the screen.<br>
					Additionally, storing and replicating the point on each slope would prove difficult, as because of the random seed,<br>
					each point had to be stored after it was generated, but before the reflection was generated.<br>
					The main successes of the project to me was the reflection. It was challenging but rewarding, <br>
					and to me looks convincing and interesting.
