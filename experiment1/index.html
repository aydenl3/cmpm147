				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project aims to be a useful tool for Dungeon Masters playing DND 5E, by allowing them to procedurally generate random loot to fill their shops.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For this project I created new a new template for the procedurally generated text, imitating the project "bad fantasy quests" given to us.<br>
					I used new fantasy names and weapon types, and imitated the silly, lighthearted tone of the previous project.<br>
					After doing this, I attempted to integrate the existing weapon scheme of DND, to make the tool more applicable to in-game use.<br>
					I did this by incorporating integers into the template, and using them to relate back to the weapon damages, types, properties, and ranges of dnd.<br>
					Finally, I innovated upon this project by storing and using the data created from this procedurally generated template.<br>
					I stored the results of each proc gen call into a list, and iterated through the list to find the integers.<br>
					I ran a simple calculation to determine the cost of the item based on the number of dice, the type of dice, or it's attack range.<br>
					This displays as the cost at the bottom of the page.<br>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was relatively simple.<br>
					The process was smooth, and was planned out from the very beginning.<br>
					The main difficuly with this extension of the original premise was modifying the original code to store the data created by the procedural generator<br>
					Additionally, I couldn't get the newlines to work on the webpage, even though glitch handles it fine. I imagine that I would have to separate the template into different divs in html?<br>
					Despite these challenges, I am happy with this final product, and am proud of the unique way it expands upon the original goals of the assignment.<br>
