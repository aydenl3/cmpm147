                    <p> <br>

						Infinite Worlds is an exploration of play and creativity through an infinite world generated by 
						code.<br>	
						This project utilizes Prof. Wes Modes framework to create synergy between art and code.<br>
						Infinite Worlds invites participants to question how randomness generates order in our natural <br>
						environment while inspiring playful experimentation.<br>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I utilize a combination of procedural generation algorithms to create a dynamically evolving virtual landscape.<br>Building upon Prof. Modes initial framework, I uniquely created a generator that makes towers of dishes, in differing variety and number, as well as differing angles.<br>.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was challenging and exciting. I had a quirky idea and ran with it, and when thinking of things that were truly infinite in this world, my roomate's dishes came to mind. I struggled alot with the generator itself. I also struggled to find assets, so I made them all myself. </p>
